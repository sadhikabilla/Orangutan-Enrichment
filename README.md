### Purpose
Studies in the wild and in captivity indicate that the great apes, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans, are among the smartest land animals on the planet. These animals require constant cognitive and physical enrichment to maintain their sharp cognitive skills and physical strength. 

### Designing a cohesive system
The setup consists of 3 components (Vines, feeder and sprinkler) that work together as a comperhensive enrichment system to encourage cooperation between the animals and promote their physical & mental well being.
